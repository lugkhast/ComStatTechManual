\section{Dataset Management Module}

The Dataset Management Module is responsible for storing, keeping track, and retrieving data. To achieve this, both MongoDB and PostgreSQL are used.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{PostgreSQL} is used for storing bookkeeping data. This includes the dataset name, references to metadata files, field types, and the like. This data naturally fits in the relational paradigm of data storage.
\item \textbf{MongoDB} is used for storing data from uploaded CSV files. This data can be highly variable in terms of schema, making this a natural fit for a document-oriented data store.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Bookkeeping}

The Django Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is used for modelling bookkeeping data and interacting with the PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
