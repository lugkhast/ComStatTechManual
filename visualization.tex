\subsubsection{Data Handler Function}
This function gets all the necessary information from the storage to the view. Creating the data handler function is necessary since data retrieval in a web application experiences "delay". In effect, no data can't be shown on screen. The developers of the system uses "promise then" function to cope with this situation. Every processes will wait the data to load then proceed to do processes when the data arrived. In this section, the necessary informations are rendered on screen after filtering the data.
