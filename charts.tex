\section{Chart Visualization}

The Chart Visualization is a part of the system that allows the user to create charts as a form of visualization upon choosing the field in their data. The module uses Google Charts API to generate the necessary charts needed for visualizing data.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Google Charts API} is the library that is being used for visualizing data in the form of charts. While using the library, requests are being thrown to the API online. 

The charts that are available in the library include bar chart, column chart, histogram, pie chart, donut chart, scatter chart and line chart. 

\item \textbf{Google ChartEditor Package} is a package that is included in the Google Charts API that lets the user edit and change the style of the map. It allows the user to change the chart title, chart color and modify legends among others. It also allows user to change between different charts.

\item \textbf{Downloading Charts} is possible within the visualization module. Using the Google Charts API, the user can download the chart that is generated when a field in the data is chosen. A request is thrown to the API and sends back a PNG format of the chart that can be downloaded.

\end{itemize}
